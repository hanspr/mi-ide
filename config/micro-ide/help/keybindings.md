# Keybindings

Custom keybindings are stored internally in micro if changed with the `> bind`
command or you can also be added in the file `~/.config/micro/bindings.json` as
discussed below.  For a list of the default keybindings in the json format used
by micro, please see the end of this file. For a more user-friendly list with
explanations of what the default hotkeys are and what they do, please see
`>help defaultkeys`

If `~/.config/micro/bindings.json` does not exist, you can simply create it.
Micro will know what to do with it.

You can use the alt keys + arrows to move word by word. Ctrl left and right move
the cursor to the start and end of the line, and ctrl up and down move the
cursor the start and end of the buffer.

You can hold shift with all of these movement actions to select while moving.


## Rebinding keys

The bindings may be rebound using the `~/.config/micro/bindings.json` file. Each
key is bound to an action.

For example, to bind `Ctrl-y` to undo and `Ctrl-z` to redo, you could put the
following in the `bindings.json` file.

```json
{
	"CtrlY": "Undo",
	"CtrlZ": "Redo"
}
```

In addition to editing your `~/.config/micro/bindings.json`, you can run
`>bind <keycombo> <action>` For a list of bindable actions, see below.

You can also chain commands when rebinding. For example, if you want Alt-s to
save and quit you can bind it like so:

```json
{
    "Alt-s": "Save,Quit"
}
```

## Binding commands

You can also bind a key to execute a command in command mode (see
`help commands`). Simply prepend the binding with `command:`. For example:

```json
{
    "Alt-p": "command:pwd"
}
```

Now when you press `Alt-p` the `pwd` command will be executed which will show
your working directory in the infobar.

You can also bind an "editable" command with `command-edit:`. This means that
micro won't immediately execute the command when you press the binding, but
instead just place the string in the infobar in command mode. For example,
you could rebind `CtrlG` to `> help`:

```json
{
    "CtrlG": "command-edit:help "
}
```

Now when you press `CtrlG`, `help` will appear in the command bar and your cursor will
be placed after it (note the space in the json that controls the cursor placement).

## Binding raw escape sequences

Only read this section if you are interested in binding keys that aren't on the
list of supported keys for binding.

One of the drawbacks of using a terminal-based editor is that the editor must
get all of its information about key events through the terminal. The terminal
sends these events in the form of escape sequences often (but not always)
starting with `0x1b`.

For example, if micro reads `\x1b[1;5D`, on most terminals this will mean the
user pressed CtrlLeft.

For many key chords though, the terminal won't send any escape code or will send
an escape code already in use. For example for `CtrlBackspace`, my terminal
sends `\u007f` (note this doesn't start with `0x1b`), which it also sends for
`Backspace` meaning micro can't bind `CtrlBackspace`.

However, some terminals do allow you to bind keys to send specific escape
sequences you define. Then from micro you can directly bind those escape
sequences to actions. For example, to bind `CtrlBackspace` you can instruct your
terminal to send `\x1bctrlback` and then bind it in `bindings.json`:

```json
{
    "\u001bctrlback": "DeleteWordLeft"
}
```

Here are some instructions for sending raw escapes in different terminals

### iTerm2

In iTerm2, you can do this in  `Preferences->Profiles->Keys` then click the `+`,
input your keybinding, and for the `Action` select `Send Escape Sequence`. For
the above example your would type `ctrlback` into the box (the `\x1b`) is
automatically sent by iTerm2.

### Linux using loadkeys

You can do this in linux using the loadkeys program.

## Unbinding keys

It is also possible to disable any of the default key bindings by use of the
`UnbindKey` action in the user's `bindings.json` file.

## Final notes

Note: On some old terminal emulators and on Windows machines, `CtrlH` should be
used for backspace.

Additionally, alt keys can be bound by using `Alt-key`. For example `Alt-a` or
`Alt-Up`. Micro supports an optional `-` between modifiers like `Alt` and
`Ctrl` so `Alt-a` could be rewritten as `Alta` (case matters for alt bindings).
This is why in the default keybindings you can see `AltShiftLeft` instead of
`Alt-ShiftLeft` (they are equivalent).
